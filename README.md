# albumsync
This code supports the best practice setup i discovered for my self.
* All images from the smartphone are automatically uploaded in full resolution to google plus albums (other web albums like dropbox and facebook are planned)
* Running this script the images will be downloaded to a local filesystem. I use a raspberry pi for and a harddisk raid.
* The online images which are not shared publicly will be replaced by a lower resolution (2048x2048), since this is for free.
* Images from my dslr (local folder system) are uploaded in lower resolution to google plus photos.
